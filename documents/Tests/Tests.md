# Tests conducted

Due to the nature of the front end we were unable to test the functionality of the User Interface, thus the tests focus on functions developed by the backend and database which are used by the front end to convey information. All user stories that do not involve interface have a test associated with them. The development team believes that they have implemented extensive testing functionality of the program produced. 

The following is a list of the tests implemented within the continous development pipeline, which must all be passed in order for the final build to be deployed to production.

## Coverall

Due to the fact that we lack the required permissions to invite "@coveralls" as a collaborator, the coverage report generated by Jest has been uploaded to the repository in order for this information to be conveyed.
